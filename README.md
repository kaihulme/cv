- Team lead for full software product and portfolio for a client at BioScientifica, with successful trial‑run held at SfE BES 2019.
- Full stack development of Spring Java web app and REST API, hosted in AWS with MySQL database.
- Utilised agile and test‑driven development, building CI/CD pipelines with CircleCI and managing my team through GitHub and Jira.
- Showing strong team management and leadership skills, I was put forward to mentor project teams the following year.

## Projects

### GANs for Alzheimer’s Disease Detection

- Thesis project studying the use of GANs as an augmentation technique for improved Alzheimer’s Disease detection in MRI volumes.
- Developed neuroimaging pre‑processing pipelines with NiPype to extract brain regions from MRI volumes for use with ML models.
- CNN classification of sliced MRI volumes and implementation of GANs in TensorFlow / Keras through custom training logic.
- Built as Python package with containerised CUDA environment for GPU deployment using Nvidia‑Docker.

### NestPi

- RasberryPi nest box camera and Flask web app for monitoring, hosted by AWS EC2 instance with RDS SQL database and S3 for video storage.
- CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub actions automates testing with Pytest and build deployment to AWS services using Elastic Beanstalk.
- Containerised Gunicorn application, with automated publishing to DockerHub and AWS instance utilising docker‑compose.

### Mental Health and Screen Time

- Data science team project for Jean Golding Institute, analysing ALSPAC data for correlation of screen usage and child mental health issues.
- Developed various multivariate model‑based imputation methods using Scikit‑Learn and XGBoost to handle missing data.
- IEEE paper with full analysis and methods available on GitHub repository.

### Machine Learning Model Analysis

- Analysis and optimisation of various classification and regression models using Scikit-Learn, Keras and PyMC3.
- Built visualisation and performance methods to compare support vector machines, neural networks and ensemble classification models.
- Implemented Bayesian linear regression with PyMC3 to embed prior domain knowledge into the model learnt during exploratory data analysis.

### Dartboard Detection

- Dartboard detection using OpenCV and traditional computer vision techniques, implemented in C++ and Python.
- Bounding box detection from images using an ensemble of Viola‑Jones cascades, Hough transform shape detectors and KMeans clustering.

### Game of Life

- Concurrent implementation of Game of Life in C (XC), using parallel programming concepts such as farming and inter‑process communication.
- Embedded application for XMOS xCORE‑200 with bit‑manipulation optimisations to maximise limited resources

### Operating System Kernel
