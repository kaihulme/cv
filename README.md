## Education

### University of Bristol

Computer Science BSc, First Class Honours, 2021

- Specialised and excelled in Machine Learning, Applied Data Science, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering units.
- Further study on areas of interest in ethical computer science and computational neuroscience.

## Work Experience

### University of Bristol, Computer Science Department

**Project Mentor and Teaching Assistant**, Sep 2019 ‑ Jun 2020

- Mentoring groups of students on their software engineering projects, providing feedback to professors and teaching assistance in coding labs.
- Evaluated progress through weekly meetings; giving technical and peer advice, resolving issues and ensuring they meet release requirements.

### Kongs of King Street

**Supervisor**, Sep 2017 ‑ Jan 2020

- Working in busy bar in Bristol alongside my studies; promoted to supervisor role which saw me supervise a team of 10+ staff each weekend.
- Responsible for opening and closing the bar, managing mine and others time under stress and ensuring the team is working together effectively.

### BioScientifica

**Software Engineer and Team Lead**, Sep 2018 ‑ May 2019

- Full software product and portfolio for client at BioScientifica, with successful trial‑run held at SfE BES 2019.
- Android application to gamify events with QR code treasure hunt quiz, targeted at early career clinicians and monitored by a team of experts.
- Developed using agile and test‑driven methodologies with version control and CI/CD using Git and CircleCI.
- Full stack development of Java web app to create and monitor events with API for communication to MySQL database hosted with AWS.
- Showing strong team management and leadership skills, I was put forward to mentor teams of students with their projects the following year.

## Projects

### GANs for Alzheimer’s Disease Detection

- Thesis project studying the use of GANs as an augmentation technique for improved Alzheimer’s Disease detection in MRI volumes.
- Using the OASIS dataset of Alzheimer’s Disease patients, built neuroimaging pre‑processing pipelines with NiPype to use data with ML models.
- Built a method for Alzheimer’s Disease classification in MRI volumes using a slice extraction method and CNN model using TensorFlow / Keras.
- Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks in TensorFlow / Keras with custom training logic and loss functions.
- Implementation of current literature on GAN models and machine learning Alzheimer’s Disease detection methods.
- Model deployment to Nvidia GPU using Docker containerisation.

### Mental Health and Screen Time

- Data science team project for Jean Golding Institute, analysing ALSPAC data for correlation of screen usage and child mental health issues.
- Mostly missing data led to analysis of various developed multivariate model‑based imputation methods using Scikit‑Learn and XGBoost.
- Using classification methods and statistical analysis it was concluded, given the data, there was little to no evidence for such a correlation.
- IEEE paper with full analysis and methods available on GitHub repository.

### Machine Learning Model Analysis

- Analysis and optimisation of various classification and regression models using Scikit‑Learn, Keras and PyMC3.
- Built visualisation and performance methods to compare support vector machines, neural networks and ensemble classification models.
- Implemented Bayesian linear regression with PyMC3 to embed prior domain knowledge into the model learnt during exploratory data analysis.
- Built Scikit‑Learn wrapper around PyMC3 regression model for comparison of Bayesian and frequentist regression methods.

### Dartboard Detection

- Dartboard detection using OpenCV and traditional computer vision techniques implemented in C++ and Python.
- Bounding box detection from images using ensemble of Viola‑Jones cascades, Hough transform shape detectors and KMeans clustering.
