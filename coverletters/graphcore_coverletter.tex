I am writing to express my interest in your Graduate Software Engineer position on the AI Test Team. I recently graduated from the University of Bristol with a First Class Honours in Computer Science, whilst working as a supervisor at a bar to fund my studies. I am a highly motivated, keen problem-solver, with extensive academic and self-taught knowledge on practical software development methodologies and machine learning methods. Confident in my Python and machine learning capabilities, shown throughout my projects and experience, I am excited for the opportunity to apply my passion for AI to solve real-world problems.

The role of AI Test Engineer has similar responsibilities to skills learnt during my machine learning methods analysis project; building visualisation and performance measures to analyse and compare machine learning models made this one of my favourite projects. Motivated to learn beyond what my university course offered, I taught myself deep learning techniques and used this knowledge during my thesis to implement Generative Adversarial Networks with TensorFlow / Keras, which meant I was excited by Bastien Arcelin's work with generative models using Graphcore IPUs to generate images of galaxies. Seeing the limitations of my Nvidia GPU it will be exciting to test out cutting edge AI hardware and see what is possible. My project for BioScientifica saw me lead and develop a real-world product for a client, where I learnt important development methodologies, communication and teamwork skills. During this project, I made use of AWS and CI/CD and I look forward to seeing how these technologies work at scale. My interest and years of experience in Linux environments and the use of Docker to manage TensorFlow GPU environments will give me further confidence whilst adapting to this new role.

Aside from the technical aspects of the job, Graphcore looks like a lovely place to work. As an avid cyclist, I was excited to hear about your lunchtime bike rides as this is my favourite way to take time away from programming. I also imagine an environment where people practice yoga is a calming one and somewhere I would love to do my work, and enjoy my yoga practice. Excelling whenever working alongside team members, I look forward to working together with new people to solve important AI problems.

I am excited for the opportunity to apply my machine learning and software development expertise and explore my potential at an exciting young company providing the next generation of AI hardware for future breakthroughs in machine intelligence. Thank you for your time and consideration, please feel free to contact me using any of my information provided at the top. I look forward to hearing from you!
